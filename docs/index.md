### Overview

Compass is a general Discord bot written in Python and hosted on Heroku. 

Check the [commands tabs](Commands/index.md) for a list of Compass's commands. 

### How do I set up Compass in my server?

Setting up Compass is pretty simple - just change your prefix if you want, set a logs and bot channel, and any mod roles you want to be able to use mod-only commands.

Check out the [Configuration page](Configuration/setup.md) for more info.
