### Overview

Compass is a general Discord bot written in Python, with features intended to simplify Discord server moderation and management. 

### Where can I find a command list? 

[Right here!](Commands/general.md)

### How do I set up Compass in my server?

Setting up Compass is pretty simple - just change the bot's prefix if you want, set a logs channel, and any mod roles you want to be able to use mod-only commands.

Check out the [Configuration page](Configuration/setup.md) for more info.
