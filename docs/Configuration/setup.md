#### Configuring Compass

Once you invite Compass to your server, setup is pretty simple - you just need to run a few quick commands:  

1. (Optional) Set the bot's prefix for your server (default `;`), ex:  
```;set_prefix $```

1. Set the roles you'd like to access mod-only commands, ex:  
```;setmodroles @modrole1 987654321123456789```

1. Set a channel for Compass logs, ex:  
```;setlogschannel #logs```

1. Sync the bot's command tree to your server:  
```;sync guild```

And that's it - Compass is ready to go!
